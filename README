This readme file contains detailed explanation of each file in the hw3.bundle.

The bundle contains the following files:

1. README

2. functions.py
  This is the corrected functions.py file. In the original file, there is a bug in the calculation of the partial
  derivatives of the function in the Jacobian matrix, where the denominator of the explicit Euler method is missing.
  The bug has been fixed.

  Some other functions are also added as classes in the file to test the accuracy of their analytical
  Jacobians.

3. testFunctions.py
  It contains tests for the routines in functions.py. The detail of each test items are introduced
  in the actual file.

4. newton.py
  This is the corrected newton.py file. There is a bug in the function "step" of the original file where the
  return value should be "x-h" instead of "x+h". The bug has been fixed.

  Some exceptions are added in the code:
  a. check if the approximated root lies outside a radius r of the initial guess x0.
  b. check if the Newton method fails to converge after the maximum number of iterations.
  c. a flag will raise if the approximated Jacobian is used.

5. testNewton.py
  It contains tests for the routines in newton.py. The detail of each test items are introduced
  in the actual file.
